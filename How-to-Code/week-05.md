# Compound Data

## define-strunct

### define-struct

많은 경우, 다른 종류의 정보를 나타내야 할 때가 있습니다.
예를 들어, 노동자의 감독관, 이름, 연봉을 표현하고 싶을 수 있습니다.
두 가지 이상의 정보가 있습니다. 이 정보들은 함께 있습니다.

이를 위해 복합 데이터가 필요합니다(compound data)
compound value를 생성하기 위한 define-struct 기본 메커니즘을 배웁니다.
복합 데이터를 위해 디자인 데이터 리세피 업데이트 방법을 배웁니다.

```
(define-struct pos (x y))
(define-struct 'struct name' 'field names')
```

define-struct 는 정의이다. 실행하면 값을 산출하지 않는다.

이 경우에는 네 개의 정의가 선언된다.

첫번쨰는 contstuctor라고 불리는 ,그리고 이것은 다음과 같이 동작합니다.

```
(make-pos 3 6)
```

그리고 이것은 position structure을 산출합니다.
x필드값은 3이고 y필드 값은 6입니다.

constructor의 인자는 순서에 의해 결정됩니다. 처음이 x그 다음이 y. 전에는 이것을 'boa constructors'라고 불렀습니다.

```
(define P1 (make-pos 3 6))
(define P2 (make-pos 2 8))
```

DrRacket에서 P1을 실행하면 `(make-pos 3 6)` 을 보여줍니다.

두 개의 selector

```
;;selector
(pos-x P1)   ;get 3
(post-y P2)  ;get 8
```

왜냐하면 P1은 make-pos 3 6 이고 그것이 x 필드는 3입니다. 그래서 P1의 pos-x는 3, P2의 pos-y는 8입니다.

make-pos 는 생성자(constructor)고 pos-x와 pos-y는 선택자(selector)다.

```
(pos? P1)      ;true
(pos? "HELLO") ;false
```

make-pos에 의해 생성되지 않는 값은 false를 산출합니다.

define-struct를 형성하는 방법은(define-struct some name)

A structure definition defines:

constructor: name-<structure-name>
selector(s): <structure-name> - <field-name>
predicate: <structure-name>?

(define-struct pos(x y)) defines:

constructor: make-pos
selecctors: pos-x pos-y
predicate: pos?

## Compound Data Definitions

### Compound Data Definitions

2 or more values that naturally belong together

[design recipes](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/77860a93562d40bda45e452ea064998b/)

consist of two or more items that naturally belong together : Compound data

- A data definition consists of four or five parts:

1. A possivle structure definition(not until week 3)
2. A type comment that defines a new type name and describes how to form data
3. one or more example of the data
4. A template for a 1 argument function operating on data of this type.

```
(define-struct player (fn ln))
;; Player is (make-player String String )
;; interp. (make-player fn ln) is a hockey player with
;;          fn is first name
;;          ln is the last name
```

데이터 조각의 해석 방법을 말해 줄 수 있어야 합니다.

```
(define P1 (make-player "Bobby" "Orr"))
(define P2 (make-player "Bohyeon" "Koo"))
```

```
(define (fn-for-player p)
(... (player-fn p) (player-ln p)))
;; Template rule used:

### Problems

#### Compound P9 - Water Balloons

```
; PROBLEM:
;
; In this problem, we will design an animation of throwing a water balloon.
; When the program starts the water balloon should appear on the left side
; of the screen, half-way up.  Since the balloon was thrown, it should
; fly across the screen, rotating in a clockwise fashion. Pressing the
; space key should cause the program to start over with the water balloon
; back at the left side of the screen.
;
; NOTE: Please include your domain analysis at the top in a comment box.
;
; Use the following images to assist you with your domain analysis:
;
;
; 1)
; 2).
; .
; 3)
; .
; 4)
;
; .
;
;
; Here is an image of the water balloon:
; (define WATER-BALLOON.)
;
;
;
; NOTE: The rotate function wants an angle in degrees as its first
; argument. By that it means Number[0, 360). As time goes by your balloon
; may end up spinning more than once, for example, you may get to a point
; where it has spun 362 degrees, which rotate won't accept.
;
; The solution to that is to use the modulo function as follows:
;
; (rotate (modulo ... 360) (text "hello" 30 "black"))
;
; where ... should be replaced by the number of degrees to rotate.
;
; NOTE: It is possible to design this program with simple atomic data,
; but we would like you to use compound data.
